The drider can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:\nAt will:\ndruidcraft\n3/day each:\nentangle\n,\ngoodberry\n1/day each:\nbarkskin\n,\npass without trace\n,\nshillelagh\nMagic Resistance.\nThe dryad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.\nSpeak with Beasts and Plants.\nThe dryad can communicate with beasts and plants as if they shared a language.\nTree Stride.\nOnce on her turn, the dryad can use 10 feet of her movement to step magically into one living tree within her reach and emerge from a second living tree within 60 feet of the first tree, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the second tree. Both trees must be Large or bigger.\nActions\nClub.\nMelee Weapon Attack:\n+2 to hit (+6 to hit with shillelagh), reach 5 ft., one target.\nHit:\n2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage, or 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage with shillelagh.\nFey Charm.\nThe dryad targets one humanoid or beast that she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the dryad, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed. The charmed creature regards the dryad as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn\u2019t under the dryad\u2019s control, it takes the dryad\u2019s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can.\nEach time the dryad or its allies do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the dryad dies, is on a different plane of existence from the target, or ends the effect as a bonus action. If a target\u2019s saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the dryad\u2019s Fey Charm for the next 24 hours.\nThe dryad can have no more than one humanoid and up to three beasts charmed at a time."

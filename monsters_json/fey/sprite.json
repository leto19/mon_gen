If its saving throw result is 5 or lower, the poisoned target falls unconscious for the same duration, or until it takes damage or another creature takes an action to shake it awake.\nHeart Sight.\nThe sprite touches a creature and magically knows the creature\u2019s current emotional state. If the target fails a DC 10 Charisma saving throw, the sprite also knows the creature\u2019s alignment. Celestials, fiends, and undead automatically fail the saving throw.\nInvisibility.\nThe sprite magically turns invisible until it attacks or casts a spell, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the sprite wears or carries is invisible with it."

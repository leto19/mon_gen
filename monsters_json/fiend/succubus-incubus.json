The two don\u2019t even need to be on the same plane of existence.\nShapechanger.\nThe fiend can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid, or back into its true form. Without wings, the fiend loses its flying speed. Other than its size and speed, its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn\u2019t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.\nActions\nClaw (Fiend Form Only).\nMelee weapon attack:\n+5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.\nHit:\n6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.\nCharm.\nOne humanoid the fiend can see within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 day. The charmed target obeys the fiend\u2019s verbal or telepathic commands. If the target suffers any harm or receives a suicidal command, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If the target successfully saves against the effect, or if the effect on it ends, the target is immune to this fiend\u2019s Charm for the next 24 hours. The fiend can have only one target charmed at a time. If it charms another, the effect on the previous target ends.\nDraining Kiss.\nThe fiend kisses a creature charmed by it or a willing creature. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against this magic, taking 32 (5d10 + 5) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target\u2019s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.\nEtherealness.\nThe fiend magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa."

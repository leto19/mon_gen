A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature\u2019s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon\u2019s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.\nBreath Weapons (Recharge 5-6).\nThe dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.\nCold Breath.\nThe dragon exhales an icy blast in a 60-foot cone.

It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon\u2019s choice). In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.\nLegendary Actions\nThe dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature\u2019s turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.\nDetect.\nThe dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.\nTail Attack.\nThe dragon makes a tail attack.\nWing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).\nThe dragon beats its wings.

The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed."

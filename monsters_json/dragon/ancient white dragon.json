The dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn\u2019t cost it extra moment.\nLegendary Resistance (3/Day). If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.\nActions\nMultiattack. The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.\nBite. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature\u2019s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon\u2019s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.\nCold Breath (Recharge 5\u20136). The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that line must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 72 (16d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nLegendary Actions\nThe dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature\u2019s turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.\nDetect.

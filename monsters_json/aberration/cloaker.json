If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the cloaker attaches to the target\u2019s head, and the target is blinded and unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached, the cloaker can make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check.\nTail.\nMelee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature.\nHit:\n7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.\nMoan.\nEach creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear its moan and that isn\u2019t an aberration must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of the cloaker\u2019s next turn. If a creature\u2019s saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cloaker\u2019s moan for the next 24 hours\nPhantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).\nThe cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn\u2019t in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.\nWhenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can\u2019t see or if it relies on senses other than sight.\nA duplicate has the cloaker\u2019s AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears."

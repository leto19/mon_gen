If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against disease or become poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target\u2019s hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.\nTentacle.\nMelee weapon attack:\n+6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.\nHit:\n7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) piercing damage.

Each creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and be stunned until the end of the otyugh\u2019s next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn\u2019t stunned."

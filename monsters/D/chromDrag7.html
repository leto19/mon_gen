</em> The dragon can breathe air and water.</p>

<p><em><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day).</strong> 
</em> If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<p><em><strong>Multiattack.</strong> 
</em> The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.</p>

<p><em><strong>Bite.</strong> 
</em> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.<em> Hit:</em> 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.</p>

<p><em><strong>Claw.</strong> 
 Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.</p>

<p><em><strong>Tail.</strong> 
 Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.</p>

<p><em><strong>Frightful Presence.</strong> 
</em> Each creature of the dragon&rsquo;s choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature&rsquo;s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon&rsquo;s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.</p>

<p><em><strong>Poison Breath (Recharge 5&ndash;6).</strong> 
</em> The dragon exhales poisonous gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 56 (16d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

<h3>Legendary Actions</h3>

<p>The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature&rsquo;s turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>

<p><em><strong>Detect.</strong> 
</em> The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.</p>

<p><em><strong>Tail Attack.</strong> 
</em> The dragon makes a tail attack.</p>

<p><em><strong>Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> 
</em> The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.</p>
